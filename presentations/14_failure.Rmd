## Where did LSE investors put their money?

```{r market_weights, fig.retina=4, out.width="100%", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
library(tidyverse)
weights <- read_csv("michie_lse_weights.csv")

weights <- weights %>% mutate(Market_Weight = as.numeric(Market_Weight))

weights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Security, Market_Weight, fill = Security,
             label = Market_Weight)) +

.pull-left[
## Rules

+ 2 Teams
+ You have until **5pm** to prepare:
    1. Your argument
    2. Slides to support your argument
    3. A potential rebuttal
+ I will spend 15 minutes helping each team
+ You can borrow up to 4 books at a time from me

#### Presentations
+ **5-5:30**: each team gets a 14 minute chance to talk
+ **5:30-5:45**: each team gets a 7 minute rebuttal
+ **5:45-5:55**: The judge (in his wisdom) deliberates and declares a winner

**There will be a prize (Athens Duty Free - TBD)!!**
]

.pull-right[
## Judging Criteria

### Making a coherent argument

+ Good slides (+)
+ Use of visuals (+)
+ Bonus points for humor (++)

### Evidence of Breadth

+ Full use of the team (+)
+ Wide range of sources (++)
