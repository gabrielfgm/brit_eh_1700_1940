## Banking and financial crises in historical perspective


>  **Warnings from history** <br> <br> 227.  The Commission recommends that an additional external member be appointed to the FPC, with particular responsibility for **taking a historical view of financial stability and systemic risk**, and drawing the attention of FPC colleagues, and the wider public through speeches and articles, to historical and international parallels to contemporary concerns. (Paragraph 1115) <br><br> -*Changing banking for good - Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards*, Vol. 1, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtpcbs/27/2704.htm](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtpcbs/27/2704.htm)

# What is a Bank?

--

![banks](balance_sheet.jpg)

---

### Leverage: Barclay's Simplified Balance Sheet, 2006

![lev](barclays_balance_sheet.png)

+ Leverage ratio $= 996,787/ 27,390 = 36.4$
---

## Leverage, Risk and Liability: Why do banks fail?

.pull-left[
### Liability-side risks

.large[
+ Runs on deposits
    - Deposits can be withdrawn at will
    - First-come-first-served
+ Can spook creditors
+ Can spark fire-sales
    - Asset-side deterioration
]
]

.pull-right[
.large[
### Asset-side risks

+ Investments also go down!
    - Economy-wide shocks (e.g. US Civil War and 'cotton famine')
    - If Barclay's assets (in 2006) declined by > 2.7% the bank is technically insolvant (net worth is negative)!

### Leverage, Risk and Liability: Why do banks fail?


### Why take on so much risk?

.large[
+ Why take on so much leverage?
    - Why do companies get bigger?
+ What happens in the case of failure?
    - Limited liability, double liability, unlimited liability
+ Seperation of ownership and control (agency problems)
]


### Why do depositors allow it?

.large[
+ Very hard to monitor
    - I give you a list of 100s of investments (bonds, stocks, land, water, gold, wine, art, etc.) and ask how much its worth. How accurate can you be?
    - Exact asset positions not public
]

#### Why not have banks hold 100% deposits in reserves?

### Leverage, Risk and Liability: solutions?

.pull-left[
![bic](banking_in_crisis.jpg)
]

.pull-right[
.large[

### Turner Suggests 2:

1. Extended liability
    - Unlikely to 'risk shift' if entire net-worth on the line

2. Regulation/Government Supervision
]]

---

## Illiquidity vs Insolvency

.large[
### Insolvency

+ Liabilities exceed assets

### Illiquidity

+ Short-run demand for cash exceeds supply
+ Assets exceed liabilities but not all held as cash

### Illiquidity $\rightarrow$ Insolvency?

+ If you need to sell in a hurry the value of your assets can decline
    - Often what begins as a 'liquidity' crisis can come to look like 'insolvency'

background-size: cover

## The Bank of England

+ Established 1694
+ A deal between government and the Bank
    - Gov't gets loan, bank gets special privileges
        + Joint-stock, limited liability
        + Monopoly as chartered bank
        + Issued banknotes

---

## The impact of the BoE?

> "Its [the BoE's] creation resulted from the coupling of the government's urgent need for money with the bank promoters' desire for the profits of both speculation and monopoly. In this it set a pattern for the formation of national banks (later called central banks) in other countries, but **its own contributions to industrial finance were negligible, if not negative.**"
<br> - Rondo Cameron, 1967

+ Monopoly deal
    - Up until 1825 other banks limited to 6 partners
    - No small denomination notes
    - Tax on notes
    
> "However useful finance is to growth in other contexts, our study reveals that England's Financial Revolution in public borrowing enabled concurrent government activities to retard economic growth during the Industrial Revolution." 
<br> - Temin and Voth, 2013.

### The path to central banking: ending commercial monopoly

.large[
#### The Banking System in 1815
+ Bank of England (London only)
+ Goldsmith bankers (London only, 6 partners max)
+ Small country banks (also 6 partners)
    - Massive growth in number
        + 1780: ~100
        + 1810: ~600

#### Sources of reform

1. End of Napoleonic Wars
2. Merchant pressure
