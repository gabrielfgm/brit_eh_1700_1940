## Was there an industrial revolution?

>"English society before 1832 did not experience an industrial revolution let alone an Industrial Revolution... [Its] causes have been so difficult to agree on because there was no 'Industrial Revolution', historians have been chasing a shadow" (Clark, 1986 in Mokyr, "Editor's introduction")

<br>

>"Was there an industrial revolution? The absurdity of the question is not that it is taken seriously but that the term is taken seriously ... by scholars who should know better" (Cameron, 1990 in Mokyr, "Editor's introduction")

> "In organic economies, an increase in the proportion of the population living in towns was possible only if agricultural productivity was rising. Simply put, if, on average, every four families in the countryside were producing enough food to feed five families, a fifth of the population could be town dwellers." (Wrigley 2018)

.pull-right[
### Macro vs Micro

+ **Macro** inventions -- "door opening breakthroughs"

## Energy

> "...it was physically impossible to produce iron and steel on the scale needed to create a modern railway system, or to construct large fleets of steel ships, or to enable each family to have a car, if the heat energy needed to smelt and process the iron and steel came from wood and charcoal." (Wrigley 2010)

## Energy: Improvements in Water

+ John Smeaton 'breastshot' waterwheel

<br>

> "If the Industrial Revolution is located in the period 1760-1830, as it frequently is, then there are good grounds for regarding it as the Age of Water Power" (Musson, *The Growth of British Industry*, 139).

<br>

>"The developments in water power also demonstrate the fact that to view the inudstiral revolution as a switch from wood and animate energy to a coal-using economy is somewhat misleading" (Mokyr, "Technological Change", 25).

>"It is conceivable to imagine an industrial revolution based on water power and linen or wool -- in fact in many places that is precisely what happened. There was no substitute for iron, however, in thousands of uses, from nails to engines. As its price fell, iron invaded terrains traditionally dominated by timber, such as bridges, ships and eventually buildings" (Mokyr, p. 27).

## Rehabilitating the industrial revolution: Berg & Hudson

.pull-left40[

### Growth is mismeasured

+ "...growth and productivity change in the period are currently underestimated"

### Growth is not the whole story

+ "...growth rates on their own are inadequate to the task of identifying and comprehending the industrial revolution"
]

.pull-right[

## What should we focus on?

> "The national accounts approach to economic growth and productivity change is not a good starting point for the analysis of fundamental economic discontinuity."
]

---

## Rehabilitating the industrial revolution: Mokyr's Example

+ Imagine the British economy as composed of two sectors
    1. Traditional
    2. Modern

> "A moment of reflection and a few simple computations indicate that for a country that undergoes structural change while it grows, very sudden accelerations in the growth rate of the kind that Rostow envisaged are simply impossible. Thus the finding that the aggregate effects of the Industrial Revolution are not overwhelming before 1820 is not surprising" (Mokyr, "Editor's introduction", 12).

> "The industrial revolution was an economic and social process which added up to much more than the sum of its measurable parts. The period saw the sectoral specialization of regions and the growth of regionally integrated economies... The movement of aggregate quantitative indicators ignores this and, as presently calculated, fails to give an accurate account of the structural shift in the nature and deployment of the workforce because the calculations rely on adult male labor."

# Questions

--

"...we cannot think of the events of the past seventy years as sudden. Seventy British years [in the period 1760-1830] passed no more rapidly" (Hughes, *Industrialization and Economic History*, p. 45). Is the term industrial revolution misleading?

--

"National income accounting, by itself, is not adequate to the task of presenting national economic activity" (Berg, p. 18). What are Berg's critiques of the Crafts-Harley view?

--

"In fact, we still know too little to be able to write convincingly the type of book Berg has attempted. Perhaps her effort will, as she hopes, spur others on" (Hoppit, p. 223). What changes would Berg and Hoppit like to see in the historiography of the industrial revolution?
