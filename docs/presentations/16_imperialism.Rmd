## Student Presentations

### The export of capital debate: a simple critique

### McCloskey

.pull-left40[
+ Overseas investment earns income
+ If you don't invest abroad need to do something else with the money
+ If you invest at home:
    - Maybe home investments yield lower returns (per Edelstein)
    - Anyway **additional** home investment should push the yield on domestic capital downward
+ Ergo investing more at home $\rightarrow$ fall in income
]

.pull-right60[
>"By reallocating resources, of course, any one sector of the economy could have grown faster... The most popular target for hypothetical reallocation has been Britain's enormous holdings of capital abroad... It is not clear, however, that exchanging domestic for foreign capital would have raised British national income. **The question is how bringing capital home could be expected to increase income and how large the increase would have been**."<br> -McCloskey 1970, p. 451
]
---

### Key assumptions of McCloskey

+ Investors *could* have invested at home or abroad
    - They *knew** about all the options
    - Equivalently, markets are integrated
+ Their decision to invest abroad tells us about relative foreign/domestic rates of return
    - This can be and has been empirically checked e.g. Edelstein, Chabot & Kurz, Goetzman & Ukov
    - "...in emphasizing the rationality of entrepreneurs denies the very notion of failure" (Kirby 1992)
+ Rates of return do not depend on investment decisions
    - Returns $\rightarrow$ investment **not** investment $\rightarrow$ returns

### Bottom line

+ This is an argument over a **counterfactual claim**: what would have happened in Britain if foreign investment had been diverted into domestic investment?
+ Counterfactual claims can only be answered with a **theory**!!

---

## Framing the debate

### Two broad questions

  1. Was it in the interests of investors to invest abroad?
  2. Was it in the "national interest" for investors to invest abroad?
      - The term "national interest" is poorly defined but usually taken here to mean grown in GDP/pc
      
---

## Was it rational for the British investor to invest so much abroad?

### Probably yes


> "When investors are given the opportunity to divide their money between home and foreign assets, the expected rate of return on domestic assets can exceed the expected rate of return on foreign assets and an unbiased, rational investor will still choose to invest a portion of her wealth overseas if the diversification benefits of foreign investment outweigh the loss of return." <br> -Chabot & Kurz, 2010

+ 518,224 individual stock or bond 28 day returns
+ The question is not whether investors should have picked foreign or investment, the question is the **optimal mix**
+ The authors compute returns by sector, test portfolios

> "The real benefit of international investing was the diversification benefit of holding foreign assets that had a low correlation with their domestic counterparts." <br> -Chabot & Kurz, 2010

## Was it socially optimal for so much investment to go abroad?

### Much harder question

1. Were there industries that *could* have raised long-run growth if pursued?
    - E.g. electrification and chemicals which become important in 20th century
    - Can investment raise productivity? Where does innovation come from?
2. Were there large social costs to foreign investments born by the public and not investors?
    - The costs of formal and informal empire in protecting the investments abroad
3. Is the market price the right metric? Maybe we should consider the amount *originally invested*?
    - Price of a security is what current holder can sell it for, **not** necessarily a reflection of the money the company got

---

## Were key domestic industries neglected?

>"Potentially successful frustrated borrowers leave no trace" <br> -Kindleberger, *Economic Growth in France and Britain*, p. 38

+ We can directly compare **observed** foreign and domestic investment
    - We cannot directly compare foreign investment and **hypothetical** domestic investment
    - Broader question of **sample selection bias**: we compare stock-exchange listed companies but this is not a random sample!
+ The case for more domestic investment:
    - Some key industries that appear important in hindsight are not extensively developed: e.g. motor industry, new techniques in steel, electricity
    - Assumption of diminishing marginal return to capital unproven: 
    
> "...in view of the fact that capital is the changing, the transforming, the dynamic element in the economy, and that it is neither homogeneous nor easily divisible, but usually lumpy and highly specific, it is by no means certain that adding to its quantity will necessarily lower its returns"<br> -Pollard, p. 502.

---

## The broader costs of foreign investment: defending British capital abroad?

+ Here, the literature on foreign investment runs into the literature on the costs of empire

### Davis and Huttenback, *Mammon and the Pursuit of Empire*

.pull-left40[
![mammon](mammon_frontis.jpg)
]

.pull-right60[
+ The strong case for the economic irrationality of empire
    - Compute costs and revenues
    - Revenues go to narrow elite
    - Costs fall on the public
        + costs of defence, administration, infrastructure, opportunity costs
    - 'Winners' are specific elites and settler colony emigres
    - 'Losers' are the British taxpayer and (obviously) the colonized

```

## Is defence like insurance? Offer's critique

+ Avner Offer offers several critiques:
    1. Defence costs per head are not sensible, consider as share of income
        + UK 2.95 % of GNP, Germany 2.86, France 4.52 (!)
    2. Defence costs in the absence of empire are not zero
        + What is the counterfactual? Argues the global trading system must be defended and benefits Britain
    3. Cannot directly compare defence costs as defence *requirements* are different
        + "If military expenditure is a form of insurance, then the higher the risk, the higher the premium required." -Offer, p. 226
    4. Should not understate how much Brits liked having the empire
        + Paid for it because they wanted it
    5. The empire was a strategic resource that paid-off in WWI
    
> "From the defence point of view, investment in empire looks very different if one stops in 1919 instead of 1912, as D. & H. chose to do."<br> -Offer, p. 235

---

## Imagining broader counterfactual histories: Cain

> "...a true perspective on its role can only be obtained by looking **beyond the confines of the cost-benefit analysis** usually adopted by economists and economic historians. Most of them recognise this to some extent." 

<br>

> "...rather than simply looking at the effects of possessing or relinquishing empire on the economic system per se, it would be more helpful to set up **a broader counterfactual enquiry**..."

<br>

> "...set it against some ***plausible* alternatives**, that is those which were actively canvassed in Britain at the time." <br> -Cain, p. 366

---

.pull-left[

### Cobden/Hobson Model

+ Possible shift in income distribution
+ More domestic investment
+ But still strong commitment to free-trade -- doubts they would have avoided imperial entanglement
    - Takes the example of Gladstone and Egypt
+ Various counterfactuals for early 20th century conflict
    - Britain less willing to shoulder defence costs, smaller anglosphere to draw on
    - War less likely?
]

.pull-right[

### "Constructive imperialism"

+ Tariff policy likely to support British infant industry/possibly cartels
+ Unlikely (per Cain) to boost growth
+ Likely to heighten conflict with Germany
+ Probably larger British military build-up, potentially WWI comes sooner (Germany claimed in 1909 that empire tariffs would be cause for war)
+ Would US support be forthcoming?

]

*****

> "Neither the radical nor the constructive imperialist alternatives would necessarily have produced a more vibrant economy, a more cohesive society or one more capable of defending itself against its enemies than the actual one presided over by gentlemanly capitalists before the 1950s."<br> -Cain, p. 372

# Question

> Is it possible to reason meaningfully about an historical counterfactual as large as the absence of British Empire?
