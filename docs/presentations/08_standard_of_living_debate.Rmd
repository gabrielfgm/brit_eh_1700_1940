## The standard of living debate

> "What happened to the standard of living of the working class during the British industrialization has probably been the most contentious issue in economic history" (Horrell & Humphries, p. 849).

<br>

> "Very few questions in economic history have been the focus of such prominent and persistent attention as the controversy about the impact of early industrialization and capitalism on the standard of living of the British working class" (Feinstein, p. 625).

## Lecture Outline

### Welfare in multiple dimensions

#### I will try to cover...



+ Wages
    - Changing views of their growth
    - Wages vs family income
+ Heights?
    - The promise and pitfalls of anthropometrics
+ Child labor
    - Growth or decline in IR?
    - Why?

.pull-right40[
#### I would like to cover

+ Mortality/Life-expectancy but we don't have time

## The old view on the standard of living

>  And did the Countenance Divine,<br>
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?<br>
And was Jerusalem builded here,<br>
Among these dark Satanic Mills?<br> -William Blake

<br>

> "A feeling very generally exists that the condition and disposition of the Working Classes is a rather ominous matter at present; that something ought to be said, something ought to be done, in regard to it." <br> -Thomas Carlyle, *Chartism*, pp. 1

<br> 

+ Early writers on the IR (Hammond and Hammond, *Town labourer*; Webb and Webb, *Industrial democracy*; Toynbee, *Lectures*) stressed the poverty, inequality and negative externalities of industrialization

+ LW computed wages and found an 80% rise in real wages between 1780 and 1850
    - To compute a real wage:
        - Measure wages in all sectors in a year $w_{1,1840}, w_{2, 1840}, ...$ (e.g. agriculture)
        - Measure how big each sector is in a year $s_{1, 1840}, s_{2, 1840}, ...$ (e.g. 30%)
        - Measure how much things cost in a year $p_{1840}$
        - Add it all up and divide by prices
    - Measurement depends on measuring wages, shares and prices!

> "The present account of trends in living standards also seems **more plausible in relation to other indicators** of well-being. It accords better with the evidence of a sharp deterioration in infant and child mortality. It eliminates the paradox of the decline in nutritional status indicated by the early nineteenth-century height data occurring at a time of an allegedly swift advance in living standards." <br> -Feinstein, p. 652

## Height as a measure of human welfare?

.pull-left[
#### Anthropometrics

+ A *net* measure
+ Lots of historical sources
+ Requires only height and age

#### But...

+ Several problems
  - Bias/truncation
  - Composition effects
  - Seperating out the cause of height change
      * Epidemics? Public health works? Child labor
  - When *exactly* do we grow?

On **average** it is not genes

>  "Newcomers to the idea that stature measures important aspects of the standard of living should not be sidetracked by genetic issues. Genes are important determinants of individual height, but genetic differences approximately cancel in comparisons of averages across most populations, and in these situations heights accurately reflect health status." -Steckel, "Stature", p. 1903

## Children's labor undercuts adult labor: vicious cycle

> "When I was just over seven I went into the boot trade.There was no room for a child my age in the kind of work my father did... But about this time an entirely new method of making shoes came up. It was called riveting ..." <br> William Arnold cited in Humphries, p. 413

### A sentimental conclusion

> "These children bore many of the social and economic costs of the industrial revolution but they also contributed to its success and thereby through time to our own comfort and prosperity. Their part in this great historical divide merits remembrance." <br> -Humphries, p. 416

## Questions

### How would *you* measure a population's "standard of living"?
