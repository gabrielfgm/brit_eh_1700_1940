## The perception of decline


> "It must be clear to everyone that we are under the shadow of a business depression...", <br> -*Banker's Magazine*, October 1883

<br>

> "Since 1862 the tide of agricultural propsperity had ceased to flow; after 1874 it turned and rapidly ebbed" <br> -Lord Ernley, *English Farming Past and Present*, 1927

<br>

> "There was, in fact, a continuous output of discussions, speeches, books, reports, and pamphlets, which prove, at least, that people thought they were depressed ... 1873 to 1896 was a period when people said there was a great depression." <br> -Beales, "The Great Depression in Industry and Trade", 1934

Might begin with the name: Great Depression

+ Now if you tell someone you spent the morning in a lecture on the Great Depression they will almost certainly think you are talking about the 1930s

widespred discussion of decline

+ 2 royal commission in 70s and 90s on agriculture
+ 2 on trade and industry
+ 1 on the monetary system
+ Widespread discussion in the Political Economy Club and House of Commons

Giffen

+ Address given to the Royal Statistical Society in 1879
+ He is chief statistical department Board of Trade
+ Since 1873 **prices of goods declining**!

The drop in prices

+ Greg Clark retail price index
+ Clearly confirms what contemporaries noted -- prolonged fall in prices in the period of the Great Depression
+ **Are price declines a depression**? 
    - Not necessarily! We call this *deflation*
        * Good for lenders bad for debtors
        * Depends **what** prices are falling

---

### What might explain the fall in prices?

> "There is an immense **diminution in the production of gold.**"<br> -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

+ Less **supply** of gold $\rightarrow$ lower prices

<br>

???

Money is confusing

+ simplest way to think about the price level is as a ratio
    - What is the ratio of money to things?
    - How many things would people offer to obtain a pound?
    - How many pounds does it take to get a thing?

--

> "...the recent course of prices... is the result in part of the diminished production **and the increased extroardinary demands upon the supply of gold.**"<br> -Giffen, *Contemporary Review*, 1885.

+ Less **demand** for gold $\rightarrow$ lower prices

--

> "The prime cause affecting prices, it seems to us, is plain enough, namely, the **excessive production** in all things, the use of machinery, the fruitfullness of the earth, far outstripping the wants of man combined with his power to purchase..."<br> -*Banker's Magazine*, 1885.

+ Increased **productivity** $\rightarrow$ lower prices

---

### Why were prices falling? Supply and demand for money

.pull-left[

+ US: Crime of '73
+ **A global phenomenon**

> "There is a greater strain upon gold through the discarding of silver in very important countries..."<br> -Goschen, Manchester Chamber of Commerce, 1885

.pull-right[
![:scale 100%](crime_73.jpg)
]

???

Crime of 73

+ US used to have a bimetallic standard
    - Dollars could be redeamed for silver **or gold**
    - Shift to gold only
+ Contraction in money supply
+ Growing demand for gold
+ This is not purely a British phenomenon!
    - The plot from Flandreau et al shows **global** prices falling

Transition

+ The background is one of monetary explanations for the fall in prices
+ But we need to consider productivity
    - Producing more with less can make goods cheaper
    - A paradigmatic case -- and one that was important to Britain, was transport

This graphic merits close study because it tells an interesting story
about the fall in the price of Wheat -- a staple of the British diet.

+ Bottom line is British price - NY price

### The Agricultural Great Depression?

> "...the existence of a great depression in agriculture was, and is, universally accepted, and farmers' sufferings have been wept over by generations of mourners."<br> -Fletcher, "The Great Depression of English Agriculture", p. 417

<br>

???

Fletcher made this point in the course of critiquing it

+ We will return to his caveats
+ But general pressure on wheat is real

### The Impact of Falling Agricultural Prices

> "Less frequently remarked upon, but equally obvious, are the long-run implications for European income distribution. Such an increase in land endowments would inevitably spell disaster for European landowners. Over-all living standards might increase, but in the long run European rents would decline, with European labor or capital benefitting." <br> -O'Rourke, "European Grain Invasion", p. 775

???

O'Rourke raises the broader question of structural transformation

+ This has echoes of contemporary debates about the winners and losers of globalization
+ The fall in agricultural prices **helped consumers**. It made their food cheaper and left them with more money leftover to spend.
+ But it hurt farmers, and generated agricultural employment.
    - It also hurt landowners and pushed down the rate of return to land

The money tenants pay to landlords we call rent

+ The effect of tying together Britain and the US was that the rent paid to landowners fell as the profitability of British land declined
+ Likewise, the **real wage**, the wage measured in terms of what it can buy, rose
+ This is a process of **convergence**: 
    - Britain had a large population working a relatively small amount of land
    - Compared to the US wages were low and rents were high. 
    - By trading with the Americas, British wages rose toward American wages, and British rents fell toward American rents
    - Conversely, American wages fell towards British wages, and American rents rose toward British rents
    - We call this **Factor Price Convergence**

Not just a British story, a European story:

+ Globalized trade placed European agriculture in stiff competition
+ In general, European **real wages** rose from the falling food prices
+ And the rents paid to European landowners/farmers fell

Productivity gains in transport and american farming pushed down prices of **traded** goods

+ Things that were harder to trade were more protected, for instance fresh milk
+ In addition, the rise in **real wages** led to Britains buying more meat and drink
+ Plus, grains are an **input** into the cost of producing animals and animal products

+ Declining productivity

### Questions:

+ Was this inevitable catch-up?
+ Were there disadvantages to industrializing first?

### Textiles/Manufactures for Export

+ Rising competition from late-Industrializers
+ Growth of '2nd Industrial Revolution'
    - Chemicals
    - Electrification

Agriculture was not the only affected industry

+ Jevons and the Coal Question
    - Hard to be as profitable as *new* coal seams
    - British manufactures faced competition from USA/Europe, esp Germany
+ Much handwringing & huge literature on 'decline'
    - Inevitable new industrializers grow quicker?
    - Inevitable that Britain could not maintain a quasi-monopoly on manufactures?

    - Rowntree confectionary moves to factory as sales quadruple in the 1890s
    - Rise of newspapers, both as entertainment **and** because of advertiser financing catering to reader consumption

In a conventional sense of the word depression it is difficult to describe the Great Depression as such

+ A period of transformation in which the British economy was exposed to increased international competition
+ A period of social disruption, in particular for landowners
+ A period of rising prosperity and new consumer opportunities for wage-earners
+ The late-19th century British experience highlights the way global market integration generates winners and losers
