# Key Themes

## Historical national accounts

+ Historical national income accounting -- attempts to measure GDP `r AutoCite(bib["broadberryBritishEconomicGrowth2015"])`
    * Is GDP a good measure of anything? 
    * Alternatives (HDI)?
    * What is the 'average' person?

---

## Reconstructing British national accounts

```{r, broadberry_et_al, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/broadberry_et_al.jpg")
```

---

## How the sausage gets made -- GDP

Three ways to measure GDP

1. Income:

$GDP =(\texttt{daily wage-rates} \times \texttt{days worked}) + \\ (\texttt{return on capital} \times \texttt{capital stock}) + \\ (\texttt{rent} \times \texttt{land area})$
 
2. Expenditure:

$GDP = \texttt{consumption} + \texttt{investment} + \texttt{government spending} + \\ \texttt{net exports}$

3. Output:

$GDP = \texttt{agricultural value added} + \texttt{industrial value added} + \\  \texttt{services value added}$

`r Citet(bib["broadberryBritishEconomicGrowth2015"])` attempt the *output* approach.

---

## How the sausage gets made -- GDP

+ How hard is output based estimation?
+ To compute output just for agriculture:
    1. estimate amount of land under different ag. uses
    2. derive trends in cropped areas
    3. and trends in crop yields
    4. derive livestock numbers 
    5. and livestock yields
    6. aggregate these numbers from farms weighted by spatial area
    7. convert total outputs to value added using prices and knowledge of cost structure
    8. convert to real prices
+ Incredibly difficult and incredibly imprecise undertaking!

## How the sausage gets made -- GDP 

+ Why do it this way?
    - Existing wage series `r AutoCite(bib["clarkConditionWorkingClass2005", "clark1381MalthusDelusion2013"])` [did not seem to match other historical evidence!](#clarkvbroadberry) `r AutoCite(bib["broadberryBritishEconomicGrowth2012"])`
    - Macro/micro ways of approaching the problem are in dialogue

--

## Is sausage healthy?

+ Do we want national accounts? Are they helpful?
    - GDP during the actual period of the industrial revolution does not seem to move
    - National accounts can give the illusion of stasis
+ By 1820 only 35% of Brits work in agriculture whereas 60-80% on the continent do:
    - A big shift in *what* people are doing

## Overcoming 'Organic'/Malthusian constraints

+ Ricardo describes diminishing *marginal* returns from land `r AutoCite(bib["wrigleyPovertyProgressPopulation2004"])`
    - What does *marginal* mean?
+ And yet population grows!
+ `r Citet(bib["clarkConditionWorkingClass2005"])` shows that the negative association of income and wages becomes a positive association after ~1650

# Productivity

---

## What accounts for the jump in growth? Productivity

+ *Productivity*: doing more with what you have
+ This does not resolve the problem, merely pushes it back (where does productivity come from?)
+ If you know:
    - Change in prices of a good
    - Change in price index
    - Change in price of inputs
+ You can compute change in productivity [@mccloskey1994, pp. 250]
    * actually need to additionally assume markups don't change a lot

---

## Productivity: the evidence from prices

>"The diminution of price has . . . been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the materials are the coarse metals. A better movement of a watch, that about the middle of the last century could have been bought for twenty pounds, may now perhaps be had for twenty shillings." 
> —Adam Smith (1976 , bk. 1, ch. 11, pt. 3) [@kelly2016WatchPrices]

---

## Productivity: the example from watches

+ Average real price in 1710: \pounds{}6
+ Average real price in 1809: \pounds{}2
+ Average fall in price: approx. -1.3% per year
    - Wages were roughly unchanged
    - adjusting for quality changes productivity gains of roughly 2% a year.

---

## Division of labor

+ In a mid-eighteenth-century description of London trades, Campbell (1747 , p. 250) described how watches “at their first appearance . . . were began and ended by one man who was called a watchmaker” but “of late years the watchmaker . . . scarce makes anything belonging to a watch. He only deploys the different tradesmen among who the art is divided.” [@kelly2016WatchPrices]

+ “...if the Demand of Watches shou’d become so very great as to find constant imployment for as many Persons . . . the Maker of the Pins, or Wheels, or Screws, or other Parts, must needs be more perfect and expeditious at his proper work, . . . than if he is also to be imploy’d in all the variety of a Watch.” [@henry_1701, pp. 42–43]
