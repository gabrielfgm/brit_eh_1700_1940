## What were the corn laws?

.pull-left[


### Tariffs on imported grain

1. **French Wars**: the price of grain is high
2. **1815**: wheat imports prohibited if price < 82s. 6d. per quarter
3. **1828**: sliding scale of duties, e.g. 
    + if price > 73, duty = 1 
    + if price = 60, duty = 27
4. **1842**: lower sliding scale
    + if price > 73, duty = 1 
    + if price = 60, duty = 14
5. **1846**: 'repeal', actual mostly flat duty
    + if price > 53, duty = 4 
    + duty + 1 as price falls up to a duty of 10
6. **1849**: duty is 1 shilling

### The 'repeal' of the corn laws

.pull-left[
![repeal_celeb](repeal_celebration.png.webp)
]

.pull-right[
+ A symbolic victory because of **who** voted for repeal.
+ Major re-allignment within conservative party
    - Peelites vs Non-Peelites
    - First of many internal party schisms on trade
        + 1903 Chamberlain Tariff debate, EU accession, Brexit
        
> "Britain’s bold move to free trade in 1846... violated the core protectionist ideology of the Conservative party while simultaneously undercutting the economic interests of the ruling landed aristocracy." <br> -Schonhardt-Bailey, p. 1
]

---

## Why?: Two broad categories of explanation

.pull-left[

#### Ideas

+ The benefits of free trade per the political economy of Smith, Ricardo, etc.

> "Writers upon political economy have already said, that the ultimate tendency of wages is to accomodate itself to the price of food. I must say that I do not believe it" <br> -Peel cited in Irwin, 1989, p. 55.

]

.pull-right[

#### Interests

> "Economists exert a minor and scarcely detectable influence on the societies in which they live... If Cobden had spoken only Yiddish, and with a stammer, and Peel had been a narrow, stupid man, England would have moved toward free trade in grain as its agricultural classes declined and its manufacturing and commercial classes grew" <br> -Stigler in Irwin, 1989, p. 41.

|Tariff| **+** | - | -/**+** |

<br>

+ Tariffs raise (**+**) the price of grain benefitting landowners
+ Tariffs reduce the purchasing power of labour (-) as food is more expensive
+ The high price of grain hurts manufacturers (-) by forcing them to pay higher wages

> "The impact of repeal on worker... depends on the ability of manufacturing to absorb the rural emigrants... They will **gain** if food is a large component of the consumption basket, but they **could lose** otherwise." <br> -O'Rourke & Williamson, p. 80
]

### What explains repeal? Schonhardt-Bailey

> "The findings of this book tell a simple but compelling story: **economic interests accounted for the momentum behind repeal**, a momentum that overshadowed almost all else. ...these same interests, left unsatisfied, could have snowballed into revolution — as Peel and others feared... Interests account for most of the dynamics of repeal, **but they do not on their own explain why reform rather than revolution emerged**... To understand that last (quite important) fraction of the whole, we require an understanding of how **the engine of interests was shaped by the forces of ideas and institutions**."<br> -SB, p. 2


.pull-left[
### Schonhardt-Bailey's Argument

+ Anti-Corn Law League
+ Chartism
+ Weakening opposition (aristocratic portfolio diversification)
]

.pull-right[

> "Peel characterized repeal as a means to preserve the traditional institutions of the British government — and, in particular, the aristocracy."<br> -SB, p. 41

.pull-left60[
## The Anti-Corn Law League Campaign

+ First modern single-issue pressure group
+ Two-fold strategy:
    - Get electors struck-off
    - Get voters qualified

## Peel's appeal to a 'territorial democracy'

.pull-left[
+ Anti-Corn Law League threatened marginal MPs
+ Shift some Cons toward repeal
+ Peel offers argument in conservative terms: 

> "Peel characterized repeal as a means to **preserve the traditional institutions of the British government** — and, in particular, the aristocracy." (SB, 41)

********

> ‘‘this [French Revolution of 1848] comes of trying to govern the country through a narrow representation in Parliament, without regarding the wishes of those outside. It is what this party behind me wanted me to do in the matter of the Corn Laws, and I would not do it’’ <br> -Peel in SB, p. 39.

### The effect of repeal

.pull-left[

#### If Britain is a 'small' economy

+ 'Small' here means the world price of manufactured goods **is not** set by Britain
    - If this is true, Ricardo's analysis holds:
    - A fall in the price of grain pushes labor out of agriculture
    - Lowers the effective cost of labor
    - Increases manufacturing employment and profits

]

.pull-right[

#### If Britain is a 'large' economy

+ 'Large' here means the world price of manufactured goods **is** set by Britain
    - If this is true, Torrens (1844) analysis holds:
    - Agricultural profits would decline
    - Real wages would rise
    - But manufacturing profits would **decline** as terms-of-trade deteriorate

]

********

> "The big difference between the "small" country and the "large" country view of Britain... is that in the former case, British capitalists paid most of the subsidy to British landlords under the Corn Laws, while in the latter case foreigners paid most of the subsidy." <br> -O'Rourke & Williamson, p. 86.

---

### The immediate effect on prices

> "the Laws appear to have made little difference to British grain prices; the ability of contemporaries to understand their own affairs is discredited, and the whole Corn Law controversy is made to seem pointless and 'much ado about nothing'"<br> -Fairly in O'Rourke and Williamson, p. 81.

+ But this does not interrogate the counter-factual
    - What would prices have been in the absence of repeal?
    - Crimean War, American Civil War
+ Williamson (1990) finds correlation of Prussian-GB grain prices
+ O'Rourke (1994) simulates counterfactual

## The Impact of Repeal

+ The big effects of repeal seem to emerge after the 1870s
+ Repeal appears to shift the composition of agricultural output
    - Farms move increasingly into non-tradables
    - 1870 grains = 25% of farm output
    - 1904 grains = 13% of farm output
+ More extreme shift in Ireland

> "The Emerald Isle was a lot greener in the second half of the nineteenth century" <br> OW, p. 89

<br> 

> "this event [repeal] alone was sufficient to give great impulse to the conversion of Irish arable land into pasture, to the concentration of farms, and to the eviction of small-scale cultivators... The Irishman, banished by the sheep and the ox, reappears on the other side of the ocean as a Fenian" <br> -Marx in OW, p. 90

## Questions

> Explain why repealing the Corn Laws should in theory yield an increase in manufacturing output.

<br>
--

> Why does the effect of Corn Law repeal on labour depend on the share of food consumption in a laborer's consumption basket?

<br>
--

> Was Peel's fear of revolution credible?
