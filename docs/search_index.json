["index.html", "British Economic History Syllabus Class Description", " British Economic History Syllabus Dr. Gabriel Geisler Mesevage Last update: 02 March, 2021 Class Description The economic transformations that occurred in Britain between 1700 and 1940 fundamentally altered how people live. Because the transformation of Britain’s economy after 1700 had repercussions both nationally and internationally, this course will touch upon global developments as well as the remarkable growth of the world’s first industrial nation. Within the span of a generation, industrial production superseded agriculture as the mainstay of British prosperity and much of the population came to inhabit large towns instead of the traditional rural village. The Industrial revolution, the success and decline of English farming, the altering character of the workplace, the origins of foreign competition, the dominance of London in international finance, the effects of the Great War and the inter-war slump are all studied. How the British economy adapted both to events in the world beyond and to shifts within Britain’s own population forms an essential theme throughout. There are many historical debates regarding Britain’s economic performance, both successes and failures, within the period 1700 to 1939 – an appreciation of all of which will be required. "],
